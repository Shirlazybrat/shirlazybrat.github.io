      <h2 class="blog">What events led you to decide that you want to be a developer?</h2>
        <p>
        After completing my master's degree in math education, a series of events caused me to rethink the future of my current career path so I began to analyze the circumstances that I would possibly face. Not being content with the possible outcomes, I began to look for careers that would allow me to learn and grow in an industry that will encourage certain freedoms and experiences that don't readily exist in other careers. I learned about coding from a friend's post on Facebook and completed some research more into what it meant to be a coder and how one could make a career of it. I was particularly drawn to the statistics around the lack of diversity in the tech industry. Approximately only 1% of web developers are black women.  That knowledge alone made me seriously consider how I could make a difference in the tech industry while doing something that I can grow to love. Following my in-depth research, I made the decision to pursue a career as a web developer. I want to use technology to create resources that will better the lives of others.

      <h2 class="blog">Why do you think you'll be a good programmer?
</h2>
        <p>
        I believe that good programmers are always eager and willing to learn new things. They are determined to solve problems and have a passion for approaching these problems in an innovative way. These qualities that I see in myself, are what attracted me to the web development career. I consider myself to be a problem solver, always thinking of ways that will make life easier or better ways to reach solutions. To me, there is always more than one solution to a problem and successful programmers are continuously looking for these better solutions. When I face a problem, I worked tirelessly to try and solve it, not giving up or giving in. To be successful programmer, the same mindset is necessary as they face many difficulties in projects, working to figure out solutions. Another key characteristics that make me a good potential programmer is the desire to learn new things. To be a programmer means to constantly learn about new resources and ideas in technology, which changes every second.  A successful  programmer must also love to learn which is the most important trait of all. My experience as an educator  more than proves that I understand and possess a passion for learning. I will be a great programmer because I understand the value of knowledge and love obtaining new information that contributes to my growth in all aspects of my life.These characteristics give me the potential to be a successful programmer.

</h2>
        <p>
        Upon my return to the states, I will be unemployed and completely committed to my career change into web development. My only potential obstacle will be moving into an apartment, which will be completed overtime to allow me to remain focused during my learning. I also have a conference in New York City the weekend of September 24th, but necessary arrangements will be made in advance to ensure that my learning is not disrupted.

      <h2 class="blog">Tell me about a time you had to solve a complex problem. How did you break down the problem into smaller units to create a solution?</h2>
        <p>
        My most complex problem came as a result of my dilemma after officially completing my master's degree program. Once I realized that there was a life-altering, and expensive, issue to resolve, I immediately began to collect my thoughts by applying logic and reasoning to how I could fix this issue. Using my immediate thoughts, I went to the internet to research possible avenues that I could take. These possibilities were utilized during the creation of my mind map, where  I wrote out possible options for what I would decide to do. Mind mapping led me to reach out to a few experts with specific inquiries. Their responses would be significant in my decision making process, providing me with facts and details that would play in role in my decision making process. In order to stick to the timeline established for reaching a solution, I combined all of my research and options to a set of approximately five plans labeled A through E, E being worst case scenario. Each plan was ordered sequentially with considerations 4 time, finance, and resources needed, which were also implemented into each plan. By completing this systematic approach to my problem, I was able to make the best decision, weighing out every possible alternative, while also creating realistic alternatives.

      <h2 class="blog">What is your technological background? Please tell us about any experience you have with tech/programming/web development.</h2>
        <p>
        I have been working on mastering the basics of HTML and CSS since January and I am now focusing my learning on JavaScript. I am also focusing on completing various challenges using JavaScript with the intentions of creating a solid foundation that will support my learning during coding bootcamp. Some of the resources that I have used include Codecademy, Khan Academy, GA Dash, Free Code Camp, Coursera, Udemy, Codewars, Exorcism.io and every other possible resource I can find. Learning JavaScript is definitely a struggle and I will continue to work daily until the beginning of coding school, approximately 3 month away which is generous amount of time to continue working to master the concepts necessary to be successful throughout the course.

      <h2 class="blog">Why are you interested in learning web development?  Where does your motivation come from?</h2>
        <p>
        Dedication, focus, determination, desire, resilience, and passion. These are the words that come to mind when I think of a bootcamp/coding school student. These are the qualities that I possess as I work towards pursuing a career as a web developer. After making the decision to change careers, I have dedicated my time completely to my learning, putting my social life on hold, as I worked consistently to gain, and retain, knowledge that will help me to move forward as a future web developer. I have, and will continue to work tirelessly to gain skills and understanding of syntax, frameworks, and methods needed for programming. My desire is to create and build applications that can be used by other people to make life easier, to solve problems using technology. This desire is what encourages me to keep growing, to work through my frustrations during my learning, never giving up. This same desire fuels my determination to pursue and achieve success. I can, and I will, be a successful web developer. I am focused on my future and how my creations will impact someone in a way that will improve their life. That's a big deal. My passion to become a “builder of things” is the driving force behind my work ethic, encouraging my resilience in the tech industry. As a person with little to no technological background, I realize that I have much to learn and am willing to go above and beyond expectations to achieve my goal. For these reasons, I believe that I am a strong candidate for any potential coding bootcamp.

      <h2 class="blog">How will this program impact your life?  How will you, in turn, positively impact the lives of others?</h2>
        <p>
        After completing my master's degree in math education, a series of events caused me to rethink the future of my current career path eventually deciding to completely change my career. I chose coding because it will allow me to learn and grow in an industry that will encourages creative freedoms and experiences that don't readily exist in other careers. An immersive program will completely change the outlook for my future as I learn a new craft and enter the tech industry as a junior developer. This decision is not be taken lightly and this program will best equip me for success. The skills that I will gain from this program will set me on a path towards innovative greatness and a life of fulfillment.
        <br>
        I was particularly drawn to the statistics around the lack of diversity in the tech industry. Approximately only 1% of web developers are black women. That knowledge alone made me seriously consider how I could make a difference in the tech industry while doing something that I can grow to love. With the use of my skills, I seek to create ways to provide equity, fairness and justice in the way people are treated. I want to use technology to create resources that will better the lives of others and this program is what I need in order to do so in an effective way. Matters surrounding diversity and closing gaps for minorities are very important to me being a part of this program will not only benefit me a  “double minority”, but will also provide encouragement for other minorities to pursue careers in web development. I plan to lead by example, exposing diverse groups to the opportunities in the tech industry, while at the same time using my creations to help people.
